              <p>
                Teams who want to borrow equipment must have between 3 and 4
                members. Otherwise, teams can have between 1 and 4 members. You
                can either form a team beforehand and come to the event or make
                teammates at the event. We will be having a team-making session.
                Note that teams must be formed by the opening ceremony at 12 PM.
